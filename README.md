# Linear-Regression-using-Scikit

Goal: To perform Linear regression on Iris dataset of the scikit library.

Results:
Mean squared error: 1.20

Variance score: -0.70

As the variance score is negative, it shows that the model performs worst. The best possible score for variance should be equal to 1.
